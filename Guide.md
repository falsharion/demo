# Instructions:

1. Create a seperate branch where you will make your own contributions.

2. Always pull and merge from the upstream branch(main branch) before making any changes.

3. Your commit messages should be clear and desctiptive e.g "made changes to the header background".
 Avoid all dem "added files", "rcfgcyt", "bombastic side eye" and other lazy/playful commit messages.

4. Your pull request descriptions should also be detailed.

5. Try your best not to force push, as it's not in line with best practices. If you must force a push, communicate with the team first.

5. Unless its absolutely necessary, try to avoid files and folders that were not designated to you. This will help us stay clear of any inputs that might lead to merge conflicts. ie. if you're working on the home page, stick to the files and folders that concern the home page only.

6. Feel free to ask for help/assistance from your team.


## Note:

1. All icons are saved as .svg file format, while the preferred format for images is .png

2. Images and icons are located in ./src/assets

3. Reusable components that will appear on multiple pages( such as the header and footer) are located in ./src/components

4. All the pages in the site are located in ./src/pages

HAPPY CODING!
